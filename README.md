# codekit-scanner

At the moment the codekit scanner is not available yet on public NPM registry. You have to 'deploy' it locally.
```
$ npm install
$ npm link
```
In the GmaApiUI or SelfServiceUI directory where the codekit-scanner is used type
```
$ npm link codekit-scanner
```
This will link to the previously installed local package.
